     * @enum Policy
     * @brief Balancing policy adopted by the scheduler.
     *
     * The values of this enum class should be used to regulate the amount of jobs to be scheduled in the global queue.
     * The tasks to be scheduled will fall in the local queues only depending on the current balancing, i.e., on the
     * number of jobs in the local queue of a thread w.r.t. the overall jobs remaining. In detail, taking as null
     * hypothesis that the jobs are perfectly evenly distributed between the threads, we have:
     *     - "relaxed": the probability to observe the current size of local queue of the thread is higher than 0.005;
     *     - "strict": the probability to observe the current size of local queue of the thread is higher than 0.05;
     *     - "strong": the probability to observe the current size of local queue of the thread is higher than 0.5;
     *     - "best": a probability that depends on the number of parallel processors.
     *
     * Other options are:
     *     - "only_local": the task will be scheduled in the given local queue;
     *     - "only_global": the task will be scheduled in the global queue;
     *
     * Notice that this impacts in the performance in opposite ways: the more jobs are scheduled in the global queue,
     * the more they will be evenly distributed, but since the accesses to the global queue are serialized, the process
     * will not scale up. Vice versa, the more jobs are scheduled locally, the more we will observe a better
     * parallelization, but they may not be evenly distributed.     *
